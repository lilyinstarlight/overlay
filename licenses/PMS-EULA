A.	You may reverse engineer the Software solely for the purpose of debugging modifications made by You to certain Third Party Files in source code format that are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL2) and only provided that You have made, prior to any such reverse engineering permitted under this sentence, unsuccessful prior reasonable good faith efforts to debug such modifications using techniques other than the reverse engineering of the Software. 

B.	Certain Third Party Files may be provided to You with the Software and licensed to You under additional terms set forth in license agreements of the third party authors of the Third Party Files and are available from Plex upon request.  Certain Third Party Files modified by Plex are provided solely for use by You except for GPL2 files.

The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by You except with Plex's prior written consent.

("JAMS").  The arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties.  In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS, which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve the dispute.  The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties.  The arbitration proceeding shall be carried on and heard in Santa Clara County, California using the English language and pursuant to the rules of (and administered by) JAMS.

A separate written license agreement or order and signed by Plex and You or Your company, employer, or principal may state other terms and conditions that apply to You, including terms relating to price, payment, delivery, confidential information, support services, and the like.  You are solely responsible to review such terms or conditions with Your company, employer or principal.  In the event of any conflict in terms, the terms of the separate license agreement shall supersede the terms of this Agreement.  Except as stated in the preceding three sentences, both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.  Any modifications to this Agreement must be in a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties and specifically referencing this paragraph of this Agreement.
