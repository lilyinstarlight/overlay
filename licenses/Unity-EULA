UNITY PRO AND UNITY PERSONAL SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT 5.X

SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT USE RESTRICTIONS

Please Read the Entire Agreement and Definitions Below

Scope of License

This Software License Agreement governs your use of the Software. Depending upon your requirements and circumstances, you will be permitted to use either Unity Professional Edition ("Unity Pro") or Unity Personal Edition ("Unity Personal," formerly known as Unity Free). This Software License Agreement governs use of both Unity Pro and Unity Personal.

Primary Differences Between Unity Pro and Unity Personal

Although Unity Personal has most of the features and functionality that Unity Pro has, Unity Personal: (a) includes certain features that cannot be disabled when your application is launched, including a Unity branded startup screen and certain analytics data collection; (b) does not provide team collaboration functionality; and (c) users will be required to complete a user survey to activate the Software. Unity Pro users who are not eligible to use Unity Personal may not develop and publish Licensee Content for the iOS and Android platforms without purchasing the applicable Unity Pro Add-On Product license. Unity may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and requirements including but not limited to monitoring the number of downloads of your Licensee Content and any available revenue estimate data.

Which Version You Can Use - Unity Personal Revenue Restrictions

Except for a thirty (30) day trial period, Unity Personal (including the iOS and Android platform deployment options) may not be used by:

a Commercial Entity that has either: (a) reached annual gross revenues in excess of US$100,000, or (b) raised funds (including but not limited to crowdfunding) in excess of US$100,000, in each case during the most recently completed fiscal year;
a Non-Commercial Entity (this means academic and governmental entities as defined below) with a total annual budget in excess of US$100,000 (for the entire Non-Commercial Entity (not just a department)) for the most recently completed fiscal year; or
an individual (not acting on behalf of a Legal Entity) or a Sole Proprietor that has reached annual gross revenues in excess of US$100,000 from its use of the Unity Software during the most recently completed fiscal year, which does not include any income earned by that individual which is unrelated to its use of the Unity Software.
Trial Use of Unity Personal

Anyone may use Unity Personal solely for non-commercial, evaluation purposes for a one time period of thirty (30) days. Users not eligible to use Unity Personal (including Users from any Non-Commercial Entity) must cease all use of Unity Personal thirty (30) days from the initial installation of Unity Personal.

You May Not Use Unity Personal with Unity Pro or any Unity Pro Add-On Products

You may not combine or integrate Licensee Content that you develop with Unity Personal simultaneously with any Licensee Content that you develop with Unity Pro or any Unity Pro Add-On Products. Licensee Content developed with Unity Personal will be tagged with an identifier that is used to enforce this restriction.

One User Per License

A specific license key is required for each individual using any version of the Software. Unity Pro users may install the Software on both a primary and a secondary computer for use only by the same user. You may not use both installations simultaneously. If you purchase a standard, single license key educational license, you must purchase a license for each computer on which the Software is to be used.

Unity Console Add-on Developer Requirements

Use of the Software with certain console platforms is subject to the Unity Console Add-on Developer Requirements as set forth on the Unity website. The license keys to enable certain Unity Console Add-ons may be distributed by the console manufacturer.

Streaming and Cloud Gaming Restrictions

You may not directly or indirectly distribute interactive Licensee Content by means of streaming or broadcasting where Licensee Content is primarily executed on a server and transmitted as a video stream or via low level graphics render commands over the open Internet to end user devices without a separate license from Unity. This restriction does not prevent end users from remotely accessing Licensee Content from an end user device that is running on another end user device.

Embedded Software Restriction

You may not directly or indirectly distribute Licensee Content installed on more than 1,000 electronic devices or systems if such Licensee Content provides the user interface or primary functionality of such electronic device or system without a separate license from Unity. This restriction does not prevent you from distributing Licensee Content pre-installed on personal computers and consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets, televisions or set top boxes as long as such Licensee Content does not provide the user interface or primary functionality of such device.

Gambling Restrictions

You may not distribute or publish any Licensee Content in connection with any Gambling Activities without a separate license from Unity.

If you are accepting the terms of this Agreement for use of Unity Personal, you represent and warrant that:

if you are accepting the terms on behalf of a Legal Entity which is a Commercial Entity, both (a) its annual gross revenues do not exceed US$100,000, or (b) raised funds (including but not limited to crowdfunding) do not exceed US$100,000, in each case during the most recently completed fiscal year and in any equivalent currency;

During the term of this Agreement, you expressly acknowledge and agree that if you are a Unity Personal user and the above thresholds are exceeded, then you may no longer use Unity Personal, and you must either purchase Unity Pro or destroy all copies of Unity Personal in your possession or control and cease distribution of any Licensee Content created with the Software. Unity will monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and requirements including but not limited to monitoring the number of downloads of your Licensee Content and any available revenue estimate data.

Unity Personal users will be required to complete a user survey in order to activate the Software.

You may not sublicense the rights granted under clause 1(1)(a), but you may sublicense the rights granted under 1(1)(b) solely to third parties to whom you license or sell Licensee Content to act as distributors thereof pursuant to an agreement no less protective of Unity and its licensors as this Agreement.
